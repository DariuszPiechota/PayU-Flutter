## Card tokenization

Card tokenization service is based on a transparent integration type which allows to accept card payments without redirecting users to a page hosted by the payment service provider. This integration type retains the security level and minimizes the PCI DSS compliance effort. It is also meant to give you more flexibility and increase conversion rates through better control over the payment process.
